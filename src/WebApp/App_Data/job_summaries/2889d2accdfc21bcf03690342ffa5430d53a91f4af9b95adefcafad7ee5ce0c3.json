  "JobDescription": "Clarity Innovations is a trusted national security partner, dedicated to safeguarding our nation\u0027s interests and delivering innovative solutions that empower the Intelligence Community (IC) and Department of Defense (DoD) to transform data into actionable intelligence, ensuring mission success in an evolving world.\n\nOur mission-first software and data engineering platform modernizes data operations, utilizing advanced workflows, CI/CD, and secure DevSecOps practices. We focus on challenges in Information Warfare, Cyber Operations, Operational Security, and Data Structuring, enabling end-to-end solutions that drive operational impact.\n\nWe are committed to delivering cutting-edge tools and capabilities that address the most complex national security challenges, empowering our partners to stay ahead of emerging threats and ensuring the success of their critical missions. At Clarity, we are people-focused and set on being a destination employer for top talent, offering an environment where innovation thrives, careers grow, and individuals are valued. Join us as we continue to lead innovation and tackle the most pressing challenges in national security.\n\nRole\n\nThis Data Engineer role is supporting the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) at Fort Liberty, North Carolina. Data Engineers in this program support the command through a combination of data stewardship and data modernization efforts. Data Engineers will be embedded within JSOC to provide subject matter expertise and technical capability for integrating complex data used by the command. Data Engineers in this program support SOCOM\u0027s initiative to be more capable and effective when leveraging their data resources.\n\nResponsibilities\nA data engineer has a deep understanding of performance optimization and data pipelining. In addition to the baseline skills of a data analyst, data engineers can make raw data more useful for the enterprise. Data engineers can create and integrate application programming interfaces (APIs). Their technical skills generally include multiple programming languages and a deep knowledge of SQL database design.\n\nThe data engineer role requires a more in-depth knowledge in programming for integrating complex models and using advanced software library frameworks to distribute large, clustered data sets. Data engineers collect and arrange data in a form that is useful for analytics. A basic knowledge in machine learning is also required to build efficient and accurate data pipelines to meet the needs for downstream users such as data scientists to create the models and analytics that produce insight.\n\nThe Data Engineer shall perform the following tasks:\n\u2022 Developing, maintaining, and testing infrastructures for data generation to transform data from various structured and unstructured data sources.\n\u2022 Develop complex queries to ensure accessibility while optimizing the performance of NoSQL and or big data infrastructure. Create and maintain optimal data pipeline architecture.\n\u2022 Build and maintain the infrastructure to support extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) of data from a wide variety of data sources. Extract data from multiple data sources, relational SQL and NoSQL databases, and other platform APIs, for data ingestion and integration.\n\u2022 Configure and manage data analytic frameworks and pipelines using databases and tools such as NoSQL, SQL, HDInsight, MongoDB, Cassandra, Neo4j, GraphDB, OrientDB, Spark, Hadoop, Kafka, Hive, and Pig.\n\u2022 Apply distributed systems concepts and principles such as consistency and availability, liveness and safety, durability, reliability, fault-tolerance, consensus algorithms.\n\u2022 Administrate cloud computing and CI/CD pipelines to include Azure, Google, and Amazon Web Service (AWS).\n\u2022 Coordinate with stakeholders, including product, data and design teams to assist with data-related technical issues and support their data infrastructure needs\n\nRequirements\n\u2022 Minimum of 1-year experience is required.\n\u2022 Bachelor\u0027s degree in a STEM field with preference towards Computer Science and Software Engineering.\n\u2022 Verifiable work experience working with data structures, database management, distributed computing, and API driven architectures using SQL and No-SQL engines.\n\u2022 A Certified Data Management Professional certification is preferred.\n\u2022 Proficient in modeling frameworks like Universal Modeling Language (UML), Agile Development, and Git Operations.\n\u2022 A Top Secret Clearance with SCI eligibility is required.\n\nPreferred Qualifications\n\u2022 Familiarity with Python, PowerBI,\n\nWe are an equal opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability, or veteran status.",
