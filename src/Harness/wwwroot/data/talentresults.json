We reflect on what happened, reassess what we'll do differently next time, and learn and grow as a team.\n\nCommit to decisions as a team. We are obligated to respectfully push back based on data and our convictions. Decision-makers are responsible for outcomes. When decisions are made through collaborative discussion, we move forward together as a team.\n\nEnergize and serve each other.

We do not tolerate inflammatory, disrespectful, aggressive, or passive-aggressive behavior under any circumstances. Regardless of the role we fill in the Develop for Good community, we are team players who galvanize each other with positivity and enthusiasm.\n\nSeek to understand and be helpful. We ask ourselves how we can help first and foremost. We don't just come with problems or complaints; we are constructive, tactful, and solution-oriented. We don't jump to conclusions; instead, we gather context and ask questions before making assumptions or delivering criticism.\n\nBe mission-minded. We utilize our diverse cultures, roles, and responsibilities to work collaboratively to achieve our unified mission of doing good. At the end of the day, we're here to try our best, grow, and dedicate our time and skills to improving the lives of others.\n\nDevelop for Good is committed to creating a diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplace.
